From science to practice my work revolves around bridging the gap between causality theory and its practical applications, particularly in the challenging context of survival analysis, addressing the intricate nuances that arise when dealing with multiple datasets.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

From science to practice my work revolves around bridging the gap between causality theory and its practical applications, particularly in the challenging context of survival analysis, addressing the intricate nuances that arise when dealing with multiple datasets.

In many instances data are collected at different points in time, where baseline information is gathered from a prior study and the outcome data are collected later. 

At the intersection of causal inference and record linkage I seek to develop statistical methods that propagates the uncertainty inherent in record linkage procedures to ensure reliable causal estimates. -->
