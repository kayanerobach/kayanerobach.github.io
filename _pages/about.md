From science to practice my work revolves around bridging the gap between causality theory and its practical applications, particularly in the challenging context of survival analysis, addressing the intricate nuances that arise when dealing with multiple datasets.

In many instances data are collected at different points in time, where baseline information is gathered from a prior study and the outcome data are collected later.

At the intersection of causal inference and record linkage I seek to develop statistical methods that propagates the uncertainty inherent in record linkage procedures to ensure reliable causal estimates.
